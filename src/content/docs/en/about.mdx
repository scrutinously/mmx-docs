<h2>MMX Blockchain</h2>

MMX is a blockchain written from scratch using proven logic from Chia's Proof of Space and SHA256 VDF similar to Solana.

Main features are:
- High performance code (1000 transactions per second or more)
- Custom high-level VM for smart contracts (similar to JavaScript)
- Variable supply (block reward scales with netspace, but also capped by TX fees)
- Consistent block times (created every 10 seconds)
- Native token and NFT support (atomic swaps with standard transactions)
- Smart contract offers for on-chain trading
- Energy efficient Proof of Space (same as Chia)
- Standard ECDSA signatures for seamless integration (same as Bitcoin)

MMX is designed to be a blockchain that can be used as an actual currency.

Variable supply will stabilize the price, one of the key properties of any currency.

Thanks to an efficient implementation, it will provide low transaction fees, even at high throughput.

Currently _testnet10_ is running. Coins farmed on testnet are _not worth anything_, now or in the future.
