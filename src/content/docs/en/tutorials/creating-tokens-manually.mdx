# Token Contracts
Token contracts can be created either as a mint by owner only token, a mint by owner and staking token, or an ownerless staking token. 
The advantage of the mint only token is that the owner address controls the supply of the token, similarly for the mint and stake token, 
the owner can create an initial supply for immediate use, and then future supply can be provided by staking. 
The advantage of the ownerless staking token is that there is no fixed supply, and new tokens can only be created through staking. 
Unlike the mint and stake, the token creator can not create a bunch of tokens out of thin air.

To deploy any contract to the blockchain, you will need to have a small amount of mmx in your wallet.

## Example
```
{
	"__type": "mmx.contract.Executable",
	"name": "Meme Coin",
	"symbol": "MEME",
	"decimals": 6,
	"binary": "mmx1rnang04sx9srtf8kxzkyrn6mj6wcgwjjmthwmflvaxpnds9ev7eqdug0ag",
	"init_args": ["mmx1owner..."]
}
```
In this example for memecoin, the decimals is set to 6 (1 million mojo equivalent) which sets 1 memecoin to the same scale as 1 mmx. 
The owner address must be set to a wallet address that you control, or else you won't be able to use the contract to mint tokens. 
This gets saved as a json file, and can then be deployed with `mmx wallet deploy /path/to/file.json`. 
When deployed, the contract will appear in the owner's wallet and tokens can be minted with `mmx wallet mint -a <amount> -x <token contract address> -t <target wallet address>`.
