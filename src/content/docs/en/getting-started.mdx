import Button from '~/components/Button.astro'
import TranslatorList from '~/components/TranslatorList.astro'
import ContributorList from '~/components/ContributorList.astro'
import PackageManagerTabs from '~/components/tabs/PackageManagerTabs.astro'

To continue enter the CLI environment:
```
cd mmx-node
source ./activate.sh
```

## Creating a Wallet

```
mmx wallet create [-f filename]
```

The file name argument is optional, by default it is `wallet.dat`, which is already included in the default configuration.

To use more wallets add the paths to `key_files` array in `config/local/Wallet.json`.

To create a wallet with a known seed hash:
```
mmx wallet create <seed_hash> [-f filename]
```

To create a wallet with a known mnemonic seed:
```
mmx wallet create --mnemonic word1 word2 ... [-f filename]
```

To get the mnemonic seed from a wallet (with Node / Wallet already running):
```
mmx wallet get seed [-j index]
```

Note: A Node / Wallet restart is needed to pick up a new wallet.

Note: Alternatively you can create a wallet in the GUI now: http://localhost:11380/gui/#/wallet/create

## Configuration
Note: Capitalization of configuration files matters. \
Note: Any config changes require a node restart to become effective.

#### Custom Farmer Reward Address

Create / Edit file `config/local/Farmer.json`:
```
{
	"reward_addr": "mmx1..."
}
```
By default the first address of the first wallet is used.

#### Custom Timelord Reward Address

Create / Edit file `config/local/TimeLord.json`:
```
{
	"reward_addr": "mmx1..."
}
```

#### Fixed Node Peers

Create / Edit file `config/local/Router.json`:
```
{
	"fixed_peers": ["192.168.0.123", "more"]
}
```

#### Enable Timelord
```
echo true > config/local/timelord
```

#### Custom data directory

To have the blockchain and DB stored in a custom directory you can set environment variable `MMX_DATA` (for example):
```
export MMX_DATA=/mnt/mmx_data/
```
A node restart is required. Optionally the previous `testnetX` folder can be copied to the new `MMX_DATA` path (after stopping the node), to avoid having to sync from scratch again.

## Plotting

To get the farmer and pool keys for plotting:
```
mmx wallet keys [-j index]
```

The node needs to be running for this command to work. (`-j` to specify the index of a non-default wallet)

Note: During plotting, the node does not need to be running (the plotter doesn't even need internet connection).

Once you're ready to make MMX plots, run the latest version of my plotter and add the parameter "-x 11337".

Download plotter here: https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-plotter/


It will show the following output at the beginning to confirm the new plot format (from testnet3 onwards):
```
Network Port: 11337 [MMX] (unique)
```
The new plots will have a name starting with "plot-mmx-". Plots created before that version are only valid on testnet1/2.

The minimum K size for mainnet will be k30, for testnets it is k26. The plots from testnet3 and onwards can be reused for mainnet later.
However there will be a time limit for k30 and k31, ~3 years for k30 and ~6 years for k31, to prevent grinding attacks in the future.

To add a plot directory add the path to `plot_dirs` array in `config/local/Harvester.json`, for example:
```
{
	"plot_dirs": [
		"/mnt/drive1/plots/",
		"/mnt/drive2/plots/",
		"C:/windows/path/example/"
	]
}
```
Directories are searched recursively by default. To disable recursive search you can set `recursive_search` to `false` in `Harvester.json`.

For the above reason, avoid adding a root directory (e.g. H:\). Instead, make a folder and place all your plots in there (e.g. H:\MMX Plots\).

## Running a Node

First perform the installation and setup steps.

To run a node for the current testnet:
```
./run_node.sh
```

You can enable port forwarding on TCP port 12338, if you want to help out the network and accept incoming connections.

To set a custom storage path for the blockchain, wallet files, etc:
```
export MMX_HOME=/your/path/
```
Wallet files will end up in `MMX_HOME`, everything else in a `testnetX` subfolder. By default `MMX_HOME` is not set, so it's the current directory.

### Reducing network traffic

If you have a slow internet connection or want to reduce traffic in general you can lower the number of connections in `config/local/Router.json`.
For example to run at the bare recommended minimum:
```
{
	"num_peers_out": 4,
	"max_connections": 4
}
```
`num_peers_out` is the maximum number of outgoing connections to synced peers. `max_connections` is the maximum total number of connections.
Keep in mind this will increase your chances of losing sync.

Another more drastic measure is to disable relaying messages to other nodes, by setting `do_relay` to `false` in `config/local/Router.json`.
However this will hurt the network, so please only disable it if absolutely necessary.

### Running in background

To run a node in the background you can enter a `screen` session:
```
screen -S node
(start node as above)
<Ctrl+A> + D (to detach)
screen -r node (to attach again)
```

### Recover from forking

To re-sync starting from a specific height: `./run_node.sh --Node.replay_height <height>`.
Or while running: `mmx node revert <height>`.
This is needed if for some reason you forked from the network. Just subtract 500 or 1000 blocks from the current height you are stuck at.
To re-sync from scratch delete `block_chain.dat` and `db` folder in `testnetX`, or run `mmx node revert 0`.

### Switching to latest testnet

After stopping the node:
```
rm NETWORK
./update.sh
./run_node.sh
```
Blockchain data are now stored in `testnetX` folder by default.


## Access WebGUI

To access WebGUI, go to: http://localhost:11380/gui/

Check $MMX_HOME/PASSWD for the login password, it's automatically generated at first launch.

Only available on localhost, because of _full access_ to your wallet.
